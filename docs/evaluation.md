| **Semantic Similarity** | 47.78%                            | 61.20%                            | +13.42%                            |


**Key Takeaways**:
- **LoRA Success**: Fine-tuning with LoRA drastically improves all metrics, especially perplexity (1147 to 6.35), making the model fluent and task-specific.
- **Semantic Gains**: BERTScore (+16.95%) and Semantic Similarity (+13.42%) confirm better meaning capture, ideal for your financial chatbot.
- **Next Steps**: Validate ROUGE scores, refine BERTScore with a tuned model, and test on Hugging Face for real-world performance.
